            <p> You are at home enjoying yourself in your small home in the kingdom when your mother slaps a bag of silver coins into your hand and sends you to go to the market. 
                She gives you a list of ingredients and tells you that you may spend any extra money on something for the family. She literally shoves you out the door. 
                Reluctantly, you head down to the market.
            </p>
            <p> As you are walking to the market, you are approached by the head general of the king's army. He stops you and begins to speak.<br> "Boy, your balance and footwork is that of a 
                natural swordsmen. I wish to make you one of my knights. You and your family will be raised in rank and given a manor and titles. Do you take it?"<br>
                "I'll have to think about it" you answer.<br> "You can find me in the kings courtyard anytime boy, ask for general Grevious." He says as he turns and leaves.
            </p>
            <p> You have used a sword before and got a basic
                education on fighting with your father before he died adventuring, but you don't remember being particularly good.<br> You watch him for a few minutes before you remember what you came
                out to do. You continue down to the market. You buy everything your mother requested and a small necklace for her.<br> On your way home, you hear an unfamiliar voice call out your name
                behind you.<br> "May I ... help you?" you ask, wondering what the hell is going on today.<br> "I have been sent" she says, "to request that you come to learn magic."<br> You are shocked,
                knowing that mages are terribly powerful but extremely rare in the kingdom. <br> "The magic has chosen you and wants you as its user. If you pass all the tests, you will be a grand mage."
                She turns to face the woods just outside of your town. "If you choose to answer the calling, go out there; the magic will guide you."<br> She turns to face you before disappearing with
                a twist of her cloak.
            </p>
            <p> Dumbfounded with the events that occured today, you begin to head home, all the while debating which you would rather be: a knight, or a mage. Which do you choose?
