            <p> You choose to follow the voice that seems to be calling you from the woods. You head towards the woods, you head deeper and deeper until you no longer recognize where you are. Which is odd as you
                have played in these woods your whole life. All of a sudden as you crest a hill you see a tower. As you stare at it you notice that a hood man has appeared out of nowhere. 
            </p>
            <p> "You've come at last" says the man "I've been waiting for you but I knew you would come, it has been foretold afterall" He cackles as his hand makes a gesture. Everything blursand the next thing you know you are standing
                in what appears to be a library. The hooded man gestures to the books, "Welcome to my library, in here you'll find knowledge on every single subject known to man. This will be your training. 
                We begin training now!"
            </p>
            <p> A few years later, you have completed your training. But before you can earn your wizard's robes to graduate from being a novice, you have to undertake a task. To utilize everything you have learned,
                you've heard rumors that a gryphon has been terrorizing a village near the border of the kingdom. You deciede that gryphon feathers would be a nice addition to your robes.
