            <p> As you make your way to the kingdom's capital to claim you reward and to notify everyone that the gryphon shall no longer be a problem, you are shocked to see the kingdom already celebrating your deeds.
                Your mentor was following you the whole time to ensure that you accomplished your task and wanting to celebrate with you notified the kingdom ahead of time. You enter the capital as a hero.
            </p>
            <p> After a fortnite's worth of festivities and feasts you are ready to head back home and visit the village in which you grew up in. As you are about to leave, you are stopped by the king. He looks at you
                clearly distressed. "Young hero, your deeds have helped the kingdom tremendously and we all thank you for that", he hesistates as he continues "However, while you were taking care of the gryphon we have been
                plagued by a red dragon. All of my finest knights and mages have gone to take care of the issue, however none of returned. I ask you to take care of this dragon, if you are able to slay the dragon, we will
                bestow upon you a royal title and we will betroth the princess to you."
