            <p> As you head towards where the dragon was last seen, you see the destruction that the dragon was caused. The dragon has been ravaging the countryside, every burnt down village you see, determination steels 
                your heart. You know that if you don't slay the dragon, this is only the beginning, the dragon will eventually burn the entire kingdom down. You continue to track it down into the mountain ranges, eventually
                you discover the dragon. You're startled at its size at first but then you think about what you've seen. Anger clouds your better judgement and you charge in!
