            <p> You choose to be a knight. You head down to the castle. Upon reach the castle, you are stopped by a guard who asks your business here. You tell him you were told to meet general Grevious
                in the courtyard. Th guard tells you to stay there while her confirms your story.
            </p>
            <p> A few minutes later, he is back to bring you to general Grevious. "Boy, you made a wise choice. I will work you hard but you will learn the code of being a knight. We start now."
            </p>
            <p> A few years later, you have completed your training. But before you can be knighted you have to undertake a mission to better the kingdom. You've heard tales of a mighty Gryphon terrorizng a village
                near the kingdom's border. You deciede that will be your testament of strength, doesn't hurt that you think a gryphon cloak would look rather dashing.
