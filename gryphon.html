            <p> You go to where the gryphon was last spotted. You can't find it but see the destruction it has caused these last few weeks. You hear a screech in the air. You look up, in the sky you see
                the gryphon soaring in the sky. 
            </p>
            <p> You've never seen a gryphon before. This creature has the body, tail and back legs of a lion, the head and wings of an eagle. With each flap of its wings you can feel the power of this creature from here
                you wonder how in the hell you're going to slay this beast. You wonder where the gryphon is going and what's it doing out in the open. You have two options of what you could do.
